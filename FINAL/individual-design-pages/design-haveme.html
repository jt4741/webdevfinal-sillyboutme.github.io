      <h3 class="display-image-text">Before NYU, I was in a really toxic environment. In the moment and even for years after, I felt like it stole so much from me. It is the sole experience and environment that caused me the most physical and emotional pain I have ever felt. It was paralyzing. When I came to New York, and I flourished, I realized that it was okay to let go of the memories and experiences that caused me so much pain. I realized I didn’t need to be defined by this time and that it IS okay to grow and move on. It is okay for me to accept the past but that my future is not defined by it. So thus, “Lost your number” was created. I wanted to create a sassy Y2K type of aesthetic because as I grew and came to this revelation, I was able to do it on my own with my own personality and I wanted that to show through before the message did.</h3>
